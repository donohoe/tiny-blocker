Tiny Blocker

Tiny Blocker is an experimental ad blocking extension for Google Chrome. 

It has no whitelist, no blacklist, and doesn't search the DOM for tell-tale ad classes and references. Instead, it blocks everything with exceptions to a few basic guesses on the domains from which content should be allowed.

In that respect it is overly aggressive but anecdotally threads the line between keeping sites usable and functional and blocking ton of unwanted code and media.
